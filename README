jQuery CAROUSEL v1.2.0

Carousel is a carousel slider jQuery plugin.
It has auto sliding and customizable animations/effects. You can change animations/effects with plugin options easily.
Carousel reads all dimension values from CSS and the plugin's options doesn't have any dimension values.

I've only tested it on
  * Chromium (18.0.1025.168),
  * Google Chrome (23.0.1246.0),
  * Mozilla Firefox (15.0),
  * Opera (12.02)
  * Internet Explorer (8.0.6001)
and it works enough for me for now!
